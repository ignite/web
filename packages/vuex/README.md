# `@starport/vuex`

A collection of Vuex store modules to help build [Starport](http://github.com/tendermint/starport) front-end applications in combination with the [Starport Vue components library](https://github.com/tendermint/vue/tree/develop/packages/vue) `@starport/vue`.

## Install

Assuming you have a Vue 3 project, just run:

```
npm install --save vuex/next
npm install --save @starport/vuex
```

## Usage

First you need to create a config file in your store root `./src/store/config.js`:

```js
// import modules
import { env, starport, blocks, wallet, transfers } from '@starport/vuex'

// init modules you need
export default function init(store) {
  transfers(store)
  starport(store)
  blocks(store)
  env(store)
  wallet(store)
}
```

Then, in your app's `./src/store/index.js` file:

```js
import { createStore } from 'vuex'
import init from './config'

const store = createStore({
  state() {
    return {}
  },
  mutations: {},
  actions: {}
})

// init @starport/vuex
init(store)

export default store
```

Finally, initialize the `env` store by dispatching the init action in the appropriate part of your app:

```js
await this.$store.dispatch('common/env/init')
```

or with a specific configuration:

```js
await this.$store.dispatch('common/env/init', {
  apiNode: 'http://localhost:1317',
  rpcNode: 'http://localhost:26657',
  wsNode: 'ws://localhost:26657/websocket',
  chainId: 'my-chain',
  addrPrefix: 'cosmos',
  sdkVersion: 'Stargate',
  getTXApi: 'http://localhost:26657/tx?hash=0x'
})
```

## Modules

The registered modules for this package are:

### env

Registered as `common/env`, this module provides basic environment setup, connection to API, RPC, and WS nodes, connection statuses, and access to the underlying `@starport/client-js` [client](https://github.com/tendermint/vue/tree/develop/packages/client-js).

```js
// Getter signatures
  getters: {
    client: (state) => state.client,
    signingClient: (state) => state.client.signingClient,
    apiTendermint: (state) => state.rpcNode,
    apiCosmos: (state) => state.apiNode,
    apiWS: (state) => state.wsNode,
    sdkVersion: (state) => state.sdkVersion,
    apiConnected: (state) => state.apiConnected,
    rpcConnected: (state) => state.rpcConnected,
    wsConnected: (state) => state.wsConnected,
  },
```

### Starport

Registered as `common/starport`, use this module if you are doing local development on a [Starport](http://github.com/tendermint/starport)-launched chain. This module configures the `env` module using the Starport `:12345/status` endpoint.

### Blocks

Registered as `common/blocks`, this module will receive, store and decode the latest 20 blocks (configurable) as they appear in the websocket API.

Get the latest 10 blocks:

```js
await this.$store.getters['common/blocks/getBlocks'](10)
```

Get the block at height 15:

```js
await this.$store.getters['common/blocks/getBlocks'](15)
```

### Transfers

Registered as `common/transfers`, this module is a temporary handcoded version until an auto-generated (by Starport) vuex store is available for the Cosmos SDK TX module (https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/proto/cosmos/tx/v1beta1).

The querying action is:

```js
ServiceGetTxsEvent({ commit, rootGetters }, { subscribe = false, all=true,  ...key })
```

The getter is:

```js
getGetTxsEvent(params)
```

So if you wanted to query for all token transfers received by `cosmos1xv9tklw7d82sezh9haa573wufgy59vmwe6xxe5`, you would first dispatch the querying action like so:

```js
await this.$store.dispatch('common/transfers/ServiceGetTxsEvent', {
  subscribe: true,
  event:
    'transfer.recipient%3D%27cosmos1xv9tklw7d82sezh9haa573wufgy59vmwe6xxe5%27'
})
```

And access the resulting state anywhere in your app like so:

```js
this.$store.getters['common/transfers/getGetTxsEvent']({
  event:
    'transfer.recipient%3D%27cosmos1xv9tklw7d82sezh9haa573wufgy59vmwe6xxe5%27'
})
```

To learn more about the WebSocket events you can query, see the [Tendermint RPC WebSocket](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/rpc/#/Websocket/subscribe) docs.

The `subscribe` flag in the action dispatch configures auto-updates for the store as new transactions occur.

### Wallet

Registered as `common/wallet`, this module provides wallet-handling, sign in and sign out fuctionalities, and encrypted persistence in the browser's local storage.

Creating a new wallet

```js
await this.$store.dispatch('common/wallet/createWalletWithMnemonic', {
  name: "My Wallet",
  mnemonic: "web fat decorate draw waste shiver toddler entire knee until board rent robust acid spatial hockey tobacco buddy buffalo flavor mass bridge report pioneer",
  HDpath: "m/44'/118'/0'/0/", // BIP32/44 derivation path
  prefix: "cosmos", // Address prfix for this chain
  password: "password"
}
```

Listing wallets in local storage

```js
const walletList = this.$store.common.wallet.wallets
```

Unlocking a specific wallet from the wallet list and logging in

```js
await this.$store.dispatch('common/wallet/unlockWallet', {
  name: 'My Wallet',
  password: 'password'
})
```

Accessing logged-in/out status:

```js
const loggedInStatus = this.$store.getters['common/wallet/loggedIn']
```

Signing out:

```js
await this.$store.dispatch('common/wallet/signOut')
```

Adding next available account to the current wallet:

```js
await this.$store.dispatch('common/wallet/addAccount')
```

Adding an account with a specific HD Path increment to the current wallet:

```js
await this.$store.dispatch('common/wallet/addAccount', 3)
```

In the example above we are assuming wallet's HD Path is `m/44'/118'/0'/0/`, will add account corresponding to `m/44'/118'/0'/0/3`.

Switch to using a different account in the current wallet (account with this address must exist in the current wallet):

```js
await this.$store.dispatch(
  'common/wallet/switchAccount',
  'cosmos1xv9tklw7d82sezh9haa573wufgy59vmwe6xxe5'
)
```

Accessing current wallet name:

```js
const walletName = this.$store.getters['common/wallet/walletName']
```

Accessing name of last wallet used:

```js
const lastWallet = this.$store.getters['common/wallet/lastWallet']
```

Accessing currently active unlocked wallet:

```js
const wallet = this.$store.getters['common/wallet/wallet']
```

Accessing currently active address in wallet:

```js
const address = this.$store.getters['common/wallet/address']
```

Inquiring if a wallet name is already in use:

```js
const isAvailable =
  this.$store.getters['common/wallet/nameAvailable'](walletNameToCheck)
```
